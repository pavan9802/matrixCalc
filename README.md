# matrixCalc
Does matrix operations such as

- Transverse

- Inverse

- Multiplication

- add and subtract methods are still being worked on

In order to run, either enter in one or two text files in the command line.(1 to find the inverese or transverse and 2 to multiply, add, or subtract)

Text files should have the following format:

t

3

3

1 0 0

0 1 0

0 0 1




The first line indicate you want to find the transverse.

The second line indicates the number of columns.

The third line indicate the number of row.

Then the following lines contain the matrix.

For the first line you can either put t for transverse, m to multiply, i for inverse, a for add, and s for subtract.

Note that when you want to multiply, add, or subtract both text files should have the respective letter on the first line.
